This is one of my projects focussing on 'Health Analytics'
Objective: Our goal is to assist clinicians in enhancing diabetes detection and treatment outcomes. To achieve this, we aim to develop a predictive model capable of accurately identifying individuals at risk of developing diabetes or experiencing diabetes-related complications. By harnessing data obtained from survey-related questions, we seek to enable early intervention and personalized healthcare strategies by clinicians. This proactive approach aims to prevent or effectively manage diabetes, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.

Dataset: The dataset utilized in this study is the Diabetes Health Indicators dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
